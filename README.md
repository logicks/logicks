- 👋 Hi, I’m @logicks and work remotely out of Katy, TX.
- 👀 I’m interested in application profiling and the automation of mundane tasks...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about generative AI and large language models...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I love assisting and working with others, particularly unblocking progress...
- 📫 I can be reached at ndrews@hotmail.com
